title: "Adding R code to package"
---

1.  Make sure to reload devtools since we opened a new session when we created the package

    ``` r
    library(devtools)
    ```

2.  Open a new R Script and write some code. This code takes the variable x and splits on every ","

    ``` r
    x <- "alpha,beta,charlie,delta"

    strsplit(x, split = ",")
    ```

3.  Let's turn it into a function

    ``` r
    strsplit1 <- function(x, split){
      
      strsplit(x, split = split)[[1]]
    }
    ```

4.  Test the function

    ``` r
    strsplit1(x, split = ",")
    ```

Output: \[1\] "alpha" "beta" "charlie" "delta"
