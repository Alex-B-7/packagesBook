title: "load_all() function"
---

1.  To get strsplit1 loaded into the console we need to run the function load_all()

    ``` r
    load_all()
    ```

Output: Loading "package name"

2.  Now we want to test the strsplit1() function again

    ``` r
    strsplit1(x, split = ",")
    ```

Output: \[1\] "alpha" "beta" "charlie" "delta"

3.  Commit the new strsplit1.R file under the "Git" pane in R Studio. Check the box in the "Staged" column then click "Commit", write a short message such as "Create strsplit1 function" and click "Commit" one last time.
