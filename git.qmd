# Setting up Git

In this chapter we will look at how to set up Git for our R package.

1.  Open GitHub and create a new repository

2.  Open a new terminal in R Studio

3.  We need to connect the remote repository from GitHub to our local repository

4.  Initialize Git

    ``` bash
    git init
    ```

5.  Add your project files to the Git repository

    ``` bash
    git add .
    ```

6.  Commit the files with the message "Initial commit"

    ``` bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

7.  Add the GitHub remote repository

    ``` bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Alex-B-7/bookDemo.git
    ```

8.  You can now check your repository on GitHub and see all of your project files
