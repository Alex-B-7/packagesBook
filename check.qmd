title: "check() function"

1.  Let's check how our package is doing so far. You can do this by running the check() function

    ``` r
    check()
    ```

Output:

checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... WARNING Non-standard license specification: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a license Standardizable: FALSE

0 errors ✔ \| 1 warning ✖ \| 0 notes ✔

2.  You should get an output similar to this with one warning indicating we don't have a license yet for the package. We will fix this later
