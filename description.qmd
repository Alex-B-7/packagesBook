title: "Description and License"
---

1.  Open the "DESCRIPTION" file that was created for you when we first create the package

2.  Edit the title to fit your package description. Example: "Exciting package for working with strings"

3.  Also edit the Author with your first and last name and email

4.  You can also change the description to explain more what your package is about

5.  When you are done editing the "DESCRIPTION" file it should look something like this:

``` bash
Package: bookDemo
Title: Exciting package for working with strings
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person("Alex", "Boyle", , "abboyle@ksu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"),
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: String manipulation package that goes above and beyond what other packages do
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a
    license
Encoding: UTF-8
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.3.2
```

6.  Now we can set up the license. I am going to use an mit license for this package

    ``` r
    use_mit_license()
    ```

7.  This will update the license portion of the "DESCRIPTION" file and also create a new "LICENSE" file and "LICENSE.md" file

8.  Commit these changes
