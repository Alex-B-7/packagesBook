title: "use_r() function"
---

1.  We want to create a new script with our function in it for our package. We can do this with the use_r() function

    ``` r
    use_r("strsplit1")
    ```

2.  Copy over the function from the original R Script into the new R Script called strsplit1.R that was just created from the use_r() function

    ``` r
    strsplit1 <- function(x, split){
      
      strsplit(x, split = split)[[1]]
    }
    ```
