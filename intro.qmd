# Getting started

First you need to open a new session in R Studio.

Install the devtools package if you don't already

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Load the devtools package

``` r
library(devtools)
```

Create the new package

``` r
create_package("~/Desktop/bookDemo")
```

After you create the package R Studio will open a new session in the working directory that you created the package with. Creating the package will create some files with it including a "DESCRIPTION" and "NAMESPACE" file along with some others.
