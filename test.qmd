1.  To further test our package we can use the use_testthat function. Go ahead and run it in the console

    ``` r
    use_testthat
    ```

2.  After running that, you will see a new "tests" folder appear in the Files tab.

3.  To create a test, use the use_test() function

    ``` r
    use_test("strsplit1")
    ```

4.  This will create a new R Script called "test-strsplit1" which is located in tests -\> testthat -\> test-strsplit1.R

5.  This new R Script will already have some code in it with a simple test:

    ``` r
    test_that("multiplication works", {
      expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
    })
    ```

6.  You can test this code by going to the "Build" tab and clicking "Test"

7.  Although this is not the code we want to test so we will need to create our own test that relates to our package. Test our package with this code:

    ``` r
    test_that("strsplit1() splits a string", {
      expect_equal(strsplit1("a,b,c", split = ","), c("a", "b", "c"))
    })
    ```

8.  The result should look like this:

    ``` r
    ==> devtools::test()
